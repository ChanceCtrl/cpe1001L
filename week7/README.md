A little interpreter for CPE1001L, nothing special, just keeping on git so I don't forget to grab files before class lol

Also I know my comments on what the "hardware" and instruction set are wrong, really this whole thing is a mess don't look too hard it was cobbled together in like an hour bc group work is fun :/
